<h2>Debugging Logs</h2>

<p class="text-info">
Arachne produces a number of debugging logs as it executes.  Select the
desired log in the sidebar.
</p>

<p>Selected area and file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Area: {{page.logArea}}
<li>File: {{page.logFile}}
</ul>

<p>
TBD: Obviously, this isn't done. We retrieve the metadata about the 
available log files, and display it in the sidebar; and by clicking in
the sidebar we come back to the Logs tab and show that we've selected
a particular log area and file.  But we still need the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li> An Arachne .json request for retrieving log entries.</li>
<li> To retrieve the selected log entries in showLog().</li>
<li> To display the retrieved log entries in a table for the given "area"
     and file.
    <ul>
    <li> Possibly with pagination.
    <li> One page could be a screen-full, or we could do one page per 
         log file.
    </ul></li>
<li> A refresh button, to reload log metadata and the latest log for
     the selected log area.</li>
</ul>
