<section SYNOPSIS>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

A <xref gofer(i)> type is a collection of recipes for computing a particular
kind of output value.  These recipes are called gofer rules; they are
implemented as Tcl ensemble commands with the interface described in this 
man page.  They are usually created using the <xref gofer(n)>
<xref gofer(n) "gofer rule"> command, but can also be created as bare
type ensembles and linked to a gofer type using the 
<xref gofer(n) "gofer rulefrom"> command.<p>

See <xref gofer(i)> before continuing here.<p>


<section "SUBCOMMANDS">

Each <xref gofer_rule(i)> ensemble must implement at least the following
subcommands.<p>

<deflist subcommands>

<defitem construct {construct <i>args...</i>}>

Given the rule's parameters in some appropriate order, returns a 
<i>gdict</i> that contains them.  The gofer type will add the 
<b>_type</b> and <b>_rule</b> keys.<p>

<defitem eval {eval <i>gdict</i>}>

Evaluates the <i>gdict</i> to produce the desired output value, e.g., 
a particular list of civilian groups.  The rule may assume that the
<i>gdict</i> is valid, but should only look at the keys listed by
<iref keys>.<p>
    
<defitem keys {keys}>

Every rule adds zero or more keys to the gofer type's gofer dictionary,
representing the rule's parameters.  This subcommand must return a list of the
names of the keys required by this particular rule.<p>

<defitem narrative {narrative <i>gdict</i> ?-brief?}>

Returns a human-readable narrative description of the rule given the
parameters in the <i>gdict</i>.  The narrative should include all of the 
relevant parameters, and should be stated as a noun phrase so that it can be 
included in other strings (e.g., in <xref tactic(i)> narratives).<p>

If the <b>-brief</b> option is included, then the length of the narrative
should be constrained in cases where the full narrative could be 
arbitrarily long, e.g., rule parameters whose values are lists can be
truncated with an ellipsis.  There is no hard constraint, but 
typical brief narratives should be no more than about 120 characters.<p>

The rule may assume that the <i>gdict</i> is valid.<p>

<defitem validate {validate <i>gdict</i>}>

Validates the <i>gdict</i>, returning it if valid, and throwing
<b>INVALID</b> on any error.  Each of the key values should be returned in
canonical form.<p>

The rule can assume that the <i>gdict</i> contains all of the keys
that the rule requires.<p>
