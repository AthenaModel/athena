<section SYNOPSIS>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

A wizpage(i) widget is a widget that forms one "page" in a wizard created
using the <xref wizman(n)> widget.  A wizard page usually displays 
data to the user, possibly allows him to enter some input, and when all
is complete allows the user to move on to the next page or to complete the
work of the wizard as a whole.<p>

Any widget can be used as a wizard page, so long as it provides the 
interface documented in this man page.<p>


<section "SUBCOMMANDS">

Each <xref wizpage(i)> ensemble must implement at least the following
subcommands.<p>

<deflist subcommands>

<defitem enter {<i>wizpage</i> enter}>

This subcommand is called whenever the wizard begins to display this page.
It must assess the state of the wizard and initialize its display 
accordingly.<p>

<defitem finished {<i>wizpage</i> finished}>

This subcommand should return 1 when it is OK to go on to the next page,
and 0 otherwise.  Usually this will involve verifying that the user has
entered the necessary data.<p>

<defitem leave {<i>wizpage</i> leave}>

This subcommand is called when the user presses the "Next" button to go
on to the next page.  It allows the page to do any work required to set up
for the next page.<p>

</deflist subcommands>
