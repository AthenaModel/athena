<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require projectlib <version>
namespace import ::projectlib::*
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

<xref scratchdir(n)> is responsible for locating and creating
scratch directories for <xref arachne(1)> and other applications that
require a well-known scratch directory.

At start up the application calls <iref scratchdir init>, optionally
passing it a specific scratch directory name.  By default, the 
scratch directory will be <tt><i appdir>/scratch/</tt>, where the 
<i appdir> is defined as for <xref appdir(n)>.

The scratch directory may be referenced by multiple applications at once,
i.e., a master application such as <xref arachne(1)> and any number of
ancillary tools, such as the <xref athena_log(1)> logbrowser.  Only the
master should write to the scratch directory.

Normally, the master application will initialize and clear the scratch 
directory:

<example>
    scratchdir init
    scratchdir clear
</example>

The <iref scratchdir clear> command also creates the normal set of 
subdirectories, e.g., <tt><i scratchdir>/log</tt>.

<section "COMMANDS">

This module defines the following commands:

<deflist commands>

<defitem "scratchdir clear" {scratchdir clear}>

Deletes the content of the scratch directory, including all subdirectories,
and creates the standard subdirectories.  It's an error to call this 
command prior to <iref scratchdir init>.

<defitem "scratchdir init" {scratchdir init ?<i>scratchdir</i>?}>

Initializes scratchdir(n).  If <i scratchdir> is given, it is normalized
and saved as the scratch directory; otherwise, the 
scratch directory will be <tt><i appdir>/scratch/</tt>, where the 
<i appdir> is defined as for <xref appdir(n)>.

Successive calls to this command in one application are no-ops.


<defitem "scratchdir join" {scratchdir join ?<i>arg arg...</i>?}>

Called with no arguments, returns the name of the scratch directory.
Otherwise, returns the path name resulting from joining the
arguments to the scratch directory.  For example, the
following command returns the absolute path of a file called
"<code>working.rdb</code>" in the RDB directory.

<pre>
set rdbfile [scratchdir join rdb working.rdb]
</pre>

</deflist commands>

<section "SEE ALSO">

<xref workdir(n)>, which creates working directories for applications like
Athena Workbench, <xref athenawb(1)>, where only the application itself
needs access to the directory.
