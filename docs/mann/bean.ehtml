<section DESCRIPTION>

A "bean" is a TclOO object that can be automatically checkpointed and restored
as part of the program's state, i.e., as part of an Athena scenario.  As such,
it is used for scenario data that is store in memory, rather than in the 
RDB.  At present, the bean mechanism assumes that <b>all</b> beans are part of 
the program state, i.e., there's no notion of multiple open documents, or
of checkpointing a subset of the beans.<p>

bean(n) is the base class for all bean classes; it provides the basic
functionality for all beans.  This man page describes this functionality,
along with the constraints on bean classes.<p>

<subsection "Defining a Bean Class">

All bean classes are created using <xref beanclass(n)> as follows:<p>

<pre>
    ::projectlib::beanclass create pet {
        # Variable and method definitions
    }
</pre>

The new <code>::pet</code> class command will be a sublcass of 
<code>::projectlib::bean</code>, and will have 
<xref beanclass(n) exists>, 
<xref beanclass(n) get>, and
<xref beanclass(n) ids> subcommands for retrieving and querying the
existence of members of the classes (and its subclasses).  See
<xref beanclass(n)> for specifics.<p>

Subclasses of <code>pet</code> also need to be defined using 
<xref beanclass(n)>:

<pre>
    ::projectlib::beanclass create dog {
        superclass pet

        # Variable and method definitions
    }
</pre>

If a bean can own other beans, it should define one or more "beanslot" 
variables; the value of a beanslot should be a list of zero or more bean
instance names.  Beanslot variables are defined in the class definition
using the <code>beanslot</code> command.<p>


<subsection "Bean IDs">

Every instance of bean(n) and its subclasses has a unique numeric ID; beans can be looked up given their IDs.  The ID is stored in a predefined instance 
variable called <code>id</code>, which cannot be changed.<p>

<subsection "Beans and Dictionaries">

A bean can be converted to and from a Tcl dictionary using its
<iref getdict> and <iref setdict> commands; this is important because
beans are often edited by the user via orders.  The keys in a bean's 
dictionary are simply its instance variable names.<p>

<b>NOTE:</b> At present, the bean mechanism does not support array 
instance variables.  Use dicts in scalar instance variables instead.<p>

<subsection "Bean Instance Variables">

Bean instance variables are just normal scalar TclOO instance variables.  The
usual way to define them is via the <code>variable</code> statement in the
beanclass definition.<p>

The variables defined in this way by a particular bean(n) subclass can be
accessed by name, without declaration, within that subclass's own code.
For example:<p>

<pre>
    ::projectlib::beanclass create dog {
        superclass pet

        variable barksound

        method bark {} { puts $barksound }
    }
</pre>

Instance variables declared by ancestor classes cannot be accessed in this way,
unless the subclass explicitly declares them.  (This is normal TclOO behavior.)
<p>

Because beans are intended to be edited by external mutators, however, 
bean(n) defines the <iref set>, <iref get>, <iref setdict>, and 
<iref getdict> methods, which may be used to set and query any bean
variables defined in the subclass or its parent classes.
(The <code>id</code> variable is a special case; it can be set in this way,
but only to itself.  Any attempt to set it to anything else results in an
error.)<p>

<subsection "Array Instance Variables">

Only scalar instance variables are included in a bean's checkpointable state.
Array instance variables cannot be checkpointed, and cannot be queried or
modified using <iref getdict>, <iref setdict>, and so on.  For structured
bean data, use dictionaries rather than arrays.<p>

<subsection "Transient Instance Variables">

It is sometimes convenient for a bean to have transient state, i.e., state data
that is preserved for the duration of an operation that lasts across several
method calls, but which should never be saved as part of a checkpoint.<p>

For example,
a tactic's "obligate" method may compute the actual resources to expend given
its parameters and the resources available; then, shortly thereafter, the
tactic's "execute" method will expend the actual resources.  The values are
transient; once strategy execution has completed for the given agent, they
are irrelevant.<p>

Such transient data shouldn't be saved in the checkpoint, as it is meaningless.  
This is easily ensured by storing the transient data in
<xref "Array Instance Variables">.<p>

<subsection "Bean Views">

The <iref getdict> method returns all of a bean's data, but not necessarily
in the most convenient form.  A flag variable might be stored as 1 or 0 
internally but be displayed as "Yes" or "No".  Numeric values might need to
be formatted.  Other data might be computed from several of the bean's 
variables on demand, or be retrieved from another bean related to this one
(i.e., from an owning bean).<p>

Consequently, we define the notion of a "view" on the bean's data.  A bean
class can support any number of alternate views.  Given a view name, the bean's
<iref view> method returns a view dictionary.<p>

Bean classes define views by overriding the <iref view> method.  Every bean
class has a default view, called ""; unless overridden, it simply returns the
<iref getdict>.  Subclasses are free to add additional keys to the default
view, and to define any additional views that might be needed.<p>

The <iref view> method is usually overridden like this:<p>

<pre>
    method view {{view ""}} {
        set result [next $view]

        # Add entries to the result dictionary given the $view name.

        return $result
    }
</pre>

If a view method doesn't recognize the view name, it should simply return
its default view.<p>

<subsection "Detecting Changes">

The bean(n) type is a <xref saveable(i)>, so that beans can be checkpointed
and restored with the Athena scenario.  Consequently, bean(n) needs to know
when there are unsaved changes to beans.  Bean subclass methods can signal that
changes have been made by calling <iref bean markchanged>.  Further, the
<iref set> method always sets the changed flag.  Thus, it is often useful for
bean methods to set instance variables using the <iref set> method, like this:

<pre>
    my set <i>var</i> <i>value</i>
</pre>

A method that makes many changes to the subclass's own variables can instead
use the normal Tcl <code>set</code> command, and call
<iref bean markchanged> when done.<p>

The bean(n) class provides <iref lappend> and <iref ldelete> methods as
well, for modifying list-valued variables with notification.<p>

<subsection "Checkpoint/Restore">

The bean(n) class object is a <xref saveable(i)>, and thus can be plugged
into Athena's checkpoint/restore mechanism.  Note that both bean IDs and
bean object names are preserved across checkpoint/restore.<p>

Beans can be checkpointed in two different ways.  In the default way, the
checkpoint string includes all bean data.  Alternatively, the individual 
beans can be stored as rows the <code>beans</code> table in a 
<xref scenariodb(n)> RDB.  This mode is selected by setting the
<iref bean configure> <b>-rdb</b> option.<p>

The <b>-rdb</b> mode uses less memory when saving than the normal mode, and
also allows bean data to be accessed by ID in SQL queries.<p>

If the beans are checkpointed with <b>-rdb</b>, they must be restored with 
<b>-rdb</b>; any given application should use one mode or the other.

<subsection "Bean Ownership and Bean Slots">

It is common for beans to own other beans, as a strategy block can own 
conditions and tactics.  Note that this pattern should be used only when
both the owner and the owned objects are user-editable, and the owned objects
are added to the owner after it is created.   Objects that are created by the
owner in its constructor ought not be beans.<p>

To put it another way, a bean may be made of non-beans by composition 
(the has-a relationship), and may contain beans given to it from outside
(the container/contained relationship).<p>

Owned beans are saved by their object command names, which are preserved
across checkpoint/restore and delete/undelete.

An instance variable that contains the names of owned beans is called a 
<i>bean slot</i>, and should be declared as such in the class definition.
For example, suppose that each instance of the dog class can own a 
tail, also defined as a bean class.  The dog class would then have a 
beanslot called "tail":<p>

<pre>
    ::projectlib::beanclass create dog {
        superclass pet

        # Variable and method definitions
        beanslot tail
    }
</pre>

The tail, for its part, must retain a pointer to its parent:<p>

<pre>
    ::projectlib::beanclass create tail {
        variable parent  ;# The dog to which the tail belongs.
    }
</pre>

The <iref addbean_> method updates both the bean slot and the added
bean's <code>parent</code> variable.<p>

Beans named in bean slots will be destroyed automatically with the owning
bean.<p>

<b>Note:</b> Sometimes a bean will have a reference to a bean it 
<i>doesn't</i> own.  For example, an owned bean will often have a reference
to its owner.  Such references must be stored in a normal instance variable,
not in a bean slot variable, as that would cause the owner to be destroyed
with the bean (potentially with other problems as well).  Further, the 
validity of such references across checkpoint/restore boundaries must be 
ensured by the application.<p>

<subsection "Delete/Undelete">

The <iref bean delete> and <iref bean undelete> commands support 
cascading deletion of beans with undo.  To delete a bean, pass its ID
to <iref bean delete>, which returns a checkpoint-like delete set.  To 
undo the deletion, pass the delete set to <iref bean undelete>.<p>

<subsection "Order Mutators">

The bean(n) class defines a number of mutators for use within
<xref order(n)> bodies.  Mutator method names end with a "_"; see, 
for example, <iref addbean_>, <iref deletebean_>, <iref movebean_> and 
<iref update_>.<p>

Each mutator has a companion method that can be overridden.  For example,
suppose certain instance variables need to be modified on every
<iref update_>.  The class can override the <iref onUpdate_> method
to make the relevant changes.<p>

<subsection "Notifier Events">

The bean(n) <xref "Order Mutators"> send out <xref notifier(n)> events
on mutate and on undo.  Every mutator sends out a 
"<code>::projectlib::bean &lt;Monitor&gt;</code>" event, as does its undo 
script.  In addition, if the class's <iref subject> is defined the 
mutators will send out more specific events from that subject.<p>


<subsection "Copy and Paste">

The <iref copydata> method returns a copy set for the bean and the 
dependent beans in its beanslots, a collection of data suitable to be 
placed on a clipboard.  The copy set is a dictionary of data with the
following content:<p>

<ul>
    <li> The keys and values from the bean's default <iref view>, which
         contains data in the user formats required for order processing.
    <li> The <b>id</b> field, and the <b>parent</b> field if present, are
         removed, since they won't apply to the pasted data.
    <li> A <b>class_</b> key is added, naming the bean's leaf class.
    <li> The beanslots in the copy set will contain a list of copy sets like 
         this, one for each owned bean, instead of the bean instance names.
</ul>

Pasting must be handled by the application, because it needs to be done
using orders.<p>


<section "CLASS COMMANDS">

This module defines the following commands:<p>

<deflist commands>

<defitem "bean changed" {bean changed}>

Returns 1 if any bean data has changed, and 0 otherwise.  (This is part of
bean(n)'s <xref saveable(i)> interface.)<p>

<defitem "bean cget" {bean cget <i>option</i>}>

Returns the value of the named class configuration option.  See
<iref bean configure> for a list of options.<p> 

<defitem "bean checkpoint" {bean checkpoint ?-saved?}>

Returns a checkpoint of all existing beans; if <b>-saved</b> is given, then
the <iref bean changed> flag is cleared.  (This is part of
bean(n)'s <xref saveable(i)> interface.)<p>

If the <iref bean configure> <b>-rdb</b> option has been set, the
individual beans will be saved in the RDB's <code>beans</code> table;
the returned checkpoint string will contain only bean metadata.<p>

If the beans are checkpointed with <b>-rdb</b>, they must be restored
with <b>-rdb</b>; any given application should use one mode or the other.<p>

<defitem "bean configure" {bean configure <i>option value ...</i>}>

Sets the value of one or more of the <xref bean(n)> class configuration
options, which are as follows:<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-onchange <i>command</i>}>

Specifies a command to call whenever any bean changes in any way.  This
is most useful as a debugging aid, as it detects every set of every
instance variable.  For significant scenario changes, use the class
<xref "Notifier Events"> instead.<p>

<defopt {-rdb <i>command</i>}>

Specifies the name of an instances of <xref scenariodb(n)> serving
as a run-time database (RDB).  This command will be used when checkpointing
and restoring the set of beans.<p> 

</deflist options> 

<defitem "bean create" {bean create <i>name</i>}>

Creates a bean(n) instance called <i>name</i>.  Application code will rarely 
use this command, as a bare bean isn't much use.<p>

<defitem "bean delete" {bean delete <i>id</i>}>

Deletes the bean with the given <i>id</i>, and returns a "delete set" 
that can be used to undelete it (under normal undo conditions).  If the
bean owns other beans and uses bean slots properly 
(see <xref "Bean Ownership and Bean Slots">) the owned beans will be 
included in the delete set and will be undeleted
with their owner.<p>

<defitem "bean dump" {bean dump}>

Returns a dump of information about all existing beans.  The output is similar
to a checkpoint, but is easier to read.<p>

<defitem "bean exists" {bean exists <i>id</i>}>

Returns 1 if there is a bean with the given <i>id</i>, and 0 otherwise.<p>

<defitem "bean get" {bean get <i>id</i>}>

Returns the bean object with the given ID, throwing an error if there is 
no such bean.<p>

<defitem "bean getslots" {bean getslots <i>cls</i>}>

Returns the names of all bean slot variables defined by <i>cls</i> and its
superclasses.<p>

<defitem "bean ids" {bean ids}>

Returns a list of the IDs of all existing beans.<p>

<defitem "bean init" {bean init}>

Initializes the bean(n) mechanism when the program is loaded.  This command
should not be called by clients.<p>

<defitem "bean lastid" {bean lastid}>

Returns the unique ID of the most recently created bean (which is, not
coincidentally, the bean with the largest ID number).<p>

<defitem "bean markchanged" {bean markchanged}>

Sets the bean(n) <iref bean changed> flag.  A bean class should call 
this when it knows that bean data has changed.  Note that all commands
defined in this man page, including <iref set>, call this routine as
needed.<p>


<defitem "bean new" {bean new}>

Creates a bean(n) instance with a name in the <code>::bean</code> namespace.
Application code will rarely use this command, as a bare bean isn't much 
use.<p>

<defitem "bean nextid" {bean nextid}>

Returns the unique ID that will be assigned to the next bean to be created.
Application code should generally not need to call this, though it might
be useful in some circumstances.  Note that <iref bean setnextid> can
be used to control ID assignment.<p>

<defitem "bean register" {bean register <i>bean</i>}>

<b>Private.</b> Registers a new <i>bean</i> object and assigns it a unique 
bean ID.  This
command is solely for the use of the bean(n) class itself, and should not
be used by clients.<p>

<defitem "bean reset" {bean reset}>

Deletes all beans and resets the bean infrastructure to its state at program
start-up.  This command is primarily for use by the test suite, though it can
also be called when creating a new scenario.<p>

<defitem "bean restore" {bean restore <i>checkpoint</i> ?-saved?}>

Restores a <i>checkpoint</i> returned by <iref bean checkpoint>.  By
default, the <iref bean changed> flag is set; if <b>-saved</b> is given,
the <iref bean changed> flag is cleared.  (This is part of
bean(n)'s <xref saveable(i)> interface.)<p>

If the <iref bean configure> <b>-rdb</b> option has been set, this 
routine assumes that the individual beans were saved in the RDB's
<code>beans</code> table, and that the <i>checkpoint</i> string
contains only bean metadata.<p>

<defitem "bean setnextid" {bean setnextid <i>nid</i>}>

Sets the bean ID, <i>nid</i>, to be returned the next time 
<iref bean nextid> is used to assign a bean ID.  The <i>nid</i> must
be greater than <iref bean lastid> to have any effect.<p>

This command is for use in <xref order(n)> <xref order(n) setredo>
scripts, to ensure that an order produces the same bean IDs on redo.<p>


<defitem "bean uncreate" {bean uncreate <i>bean</i>}>

This command is used by the undo code for bean(n) mutators that create new 
beans.  When creation of a bean is undone, the ID counter used to assign 
bean IDs must be reset.  This command verifies that the <i>bean</i> is
the most recently created bean, destroys it, and decrements the ID 
counter.<p> 

<defitem "bean undelete" {bean undelete <i>deleteSet</i>}>

Undoes a call to <iref bean delete> given the <i>deleteSet</i> returned
by <iref bean delete>.  Normal undo conditions apply; if any other changes
have been made to beans since the deletion, they must be undone first.<p>

<defitem "bean unregister" {bean unregister <i>id</i>}>

<b>Private.</b> Unregisters the bean with the given <i>id</i> when it is 
destroyed.  This
command is solely for the use of the bean(n) class itself, and should not
be used by clients.<p>

<defitem "bean view" {bean view <i>id</i> ?<i>view</i>?}>

Returns a view dictionary for the bean with the given <i>id</i>.<p>

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMANDS">

Instances of bean(n), and instances of subclasses, have the following
subcommands.<p>

<deflist instance>

<defitem addbean_ {<i>bean</i> addbean_ <i>slot cls</i> ?<i>beanvar</i>?}>

<b>Protected.</b>  This mutator creates a new bean of class <i>cls</i>,
and appends it to the named <i>slot</i> variable, 
returns a script that will undo the change.  If <i>beanvar</i> is given,
it is the name of a variable in the caller's context; this variable
will receive the newly added bean object's name.<p>

In addition, the mutator performs the following actions after modifying
the slot variable:<p>

<ul>
<li> Call <iref onAddBean_>, which by default does nothing.
     Subclasses should override this method rather than <iref addbean_> 
     itself.<p>

<li> Sends a detailed notifier event, if <iref subject> is defined:<p>
    <pre>$subject &lt;$slot&gt; add $id $bean_id</pre><p>

<li> Send a generic notifier event:<p>
    <pre>::bean &lt;Monitor&gt;</pre><p>
</ul>

The undo script will undo the change; it will also:<p>

<ul>
<li> Send a detailed notifier event, if <iref subject> is defined:<p>
    <pre>$subject &lt;$slot&gt; delete $id $bean_id</pre><p>

<li> Send a generic notifier event:<p>
    <pre>::bean &lt;Monitor&gt;</pre><p>
</ul>

Subclasses will usually wrap this in a mutator specific to the slot.<p>

<defitem cget {<i>bean</i> cget <i>option</i>}>

This method is simply syntactic sugar around <iref get>.  The
<i>option</i> names are simply the object's instance variables in
option form, i.e., "-varname" gets the variable named "varname".<p>

<defitem configure {<i>bean</i> configure ?<i>option value...</i>?}>

This method is simply syntactic sugar around <iref setdict>.  The
<i>option</i> names are simply the object's instance variables in
option form, i.e., "-varname" sets the variable named "varname".<p>

The <iref set> method is used to save the <i>value</i>; if any
validation is to be done, the child class should override 
<iref set>.<p>

<defitem copydata {<i>bean</i> copydata}>

Returns a "copy set" value that can be used to duplicate the <i>bean</i>
and its dependents.  See <xref "Copy and Paste"> for a description of
how to implement copy and paste.<p>

<defitem deletebean_ {<i>bean</i> deletebean_ <i>slot id</i>}>

<b>Protected.</b>  This mutator deletes the bean with the given <i>id</i> 
from the named bean <i>slot</i> variable, destroys the bean, and 
returns a script that will undo the change.<p>

In addition, the mutator performs the following actions after modifying
the slot variable:<p>

<ul>
<li> Call <iref onDeleteBean_>, which by default does nothing.
     Subclasses should override this method rather than <iref deletebean_> 
     itself.<p>

<li> Send a detailed notifier event, if <iref subject> is defined:<p>
    <pre>$subject &lt;$slot&gt; delete $id $bean_id</pre><p>

<li> Send a generic notifier event:<p>
    <pre>::bean &lt;Monitor&gt;</pre><p>
</ul>

The undo script will undo the change; it will also:<p>

<ul>
<li> Send a detailed notifier event, if <iref subject> is defined:<p>
    <pre>$subject &lt;$slot&gt; add $id $bean_id</pre><p>

<li> Send a generic notifier event:<p>
    <pre>::bean &lt;Monitor&gt;</pre><p>
</ul>

This method is protected; subclasses will need to wrap it in a more 
specific mutator.<p>

<defitem destroyslots {<i>bean</i> destroyslots <i>slot...</i>}>

<b>Protected.</b>  This command destroys all beans listed in the named
bean <i>slot</i> variables.  It is primarily intended to be called from 
the bean base class destructor, but it can also be used when resetting the 
slot owner's state.<p>

<iref destroyslots> is useful because it avoids to common errors in 
implementing destructors for beans that own other beans.  First, if there is
an error in calling the constructor then the bean's destructor is called; and
if a slot variable hasn't yet been initialized and the destructor tries to
clean it up in a naive way, it will throw an unknown variable error.  Second,
the <iref bean reset> command can sometimes destroy beans out of order, so
that a bean named by a slot no longer exists.  <iref destroyslots> handles
both of these cases automatically, thus simplifying the destructor.

When using <iref destroyslots> to reset a bean owner's state, i.e., in a 
"reset" method, be aware that <iref destroyslots> does not change the value 
of the slot variables.  The subclass must clear them explicitly.<p>

<defitem get {<i>bean</i> get <i>var</i>}>

Returns the value of the instance variable named <i>var</i>.  It's an
error if there is no such variable.<p>

<defitem getdict {<i>bean</i> getdict}>

Returns the bean's state as a dictionary. The keys are the names of the bean's
instance variables, and the values are (naturally) the values of the instance
variables.<p>

<defitem getowned {<i>bean</i> getowned ?-shallow|-deep?}>

Returns a list of the beans owned by <i>bean</i>, i.e., those named
in bean slots.  With the 
<code>-shallow</code> option, the list contains only those beans owned 
directly by <i>bean</i> itself.  With the <code>-deep</code> option
(the default), the list contains all beans in <i>bean</i>'s ownership
tree, whether owned directly or indirectly.<p>

<defitem getslots {<i>bean</i> getslots}>

Returns the names of the bean slot variables for this object.<p>

<defitem id {<i>bean</i> id}>

Returns the bean's unique ID.  See <xref "Bean IDs">.<p>

<defitem lappend {<i>bean</i> lappend <i>listvar value...</i>}>

Appends the value(s) to the instance variable called <i>listvar</i>,
and sets the <iref bean changed> flag.  (This is a convenience
wrapper around <iref set>.)<p>

<defitem ldelete {<i>bean</i> ldelete <i>listvar value</i>}>

Deletes the value from the instance variable called <i>listvar</i>,
and sets the <iref bean changed> flag.  (This is a convenience
wrapper around <iref set>.)<p>

<defitem movebean_ {<i>bean</i> movebean_ <i>slot bean_id where</i>}>

<b>Protected.</b>  This mutator moves the bean with the given <i>bean_id</i>
to a different place in the same <i>slot</i> given the <i>where</i>
value, which is an <xref projtypes(n) emoveitem(n)> value, and returns 
a script that will undo the change.<p>

In addition, the mutator performs the following actions after modifying
the slot variable:<p>

<ul>
<li> Call <iref onMoveBean_>, which by default does nothing.
     Subclasses should override this method rather than <iref movebean_> 
     itself.<p>

<li> Sends a detailed notifier event, if <iref subject> is defined:<p>
    <pre>$subject &lt;$slot&gt; move $id $bean_id</pre><p>

<li> Send a generic notifier event:<p>
    <pre>::bean &lt;Monitor&gt;</pre><p>
</ul>

The undo script will undo the change; it will also:<p>

<ul>
<li> Send a detailed notifier event, if <iref subject> is defined:<p>
    <pre>$subject &lt;$slot&gt; move $id $bean_id</pre><p>

<li> Send a generic notifier event:<p>
    <pre>::bean &lt;Monitor&gt;</pre><p>
</ul>

Subclasses will usually wrap this in a mutator specific to the slot.<p>

<defitem onAddBean_ {<i>bean</i> onAddBean_ <i>slot bean_id</i>}>

<b>Protected.</b>  This method is called when a bean is added to
the named <i>slot</i> by the <iref addbean_> method.  Subclasses 
can override this to take some additional action when a bean is added; 
this is preferable to overriding <iref addbean_>, as <iref onAddBean_> is 
guaranteed to be called after the slot is modified but before any
notifications are sent.<p>

<defitem onDeleteBean_ {<i>bean</i> onDeleteBean_ <i>slot bean_id</i>}>

<b>Protected.</b>  This method is called when a bean is deleted from
the named <i>slot</i> by the <iref deletebean_> method.  Subclasses 
can override this to take some additional action when a bean is deleted; 
this is preferable to overriding <iref deletebean_>, as 
<iref onDeleteBean_> is guaranteed to be called after the slot is 
modified but before any notifications are sent.<p>

<defitem onMoveBean_ {<i>bean</i> onMoveBean_ <i>slot bean_id</i>}>

<b>Protected.</b>  This method is called when a bean is moved in a slot
by the <iref movebean_> method.  Subclasses can override this to 
take some additional action when a bean is moved; this is preferable
to overriding <iref movebean_>, as <iref onMoveBean_> is 
guaranteed to be called after the slot is modified but before any
notifications are sent.<p>

<defitem onUpdate_ {<i>bean</i> onUpdate_}>

<b>Protected.</b>  This method is called when a bean is updated
by the <iref update_> method.  Subclasses 
can override this to take some additional action when a bean is 
updated; this is preferable to overriding <iref update_>, as
<iref onUpdate_> is guaranteed to be called after the bean is 
modified but before any notifications are sent.</i><p>

<defitem set {<i>bean</i> set <i>var value</i>}>

Sets the <i>value</i> of the instance variable named <i>var</i>, and sets
the <iref bean changed> flag.  It is an
error to set the value of an undefined variable.<p>

Because the changed flag is set, bean methods will usually want to use
this method to set the value of instance variables, rather than the
normal Tcl <code>set</code> command.<p>

<defitem setdict {<i>bean</i> setdict <i>dict</i>}>

Updates the bean's variables given a dictionary of variable names and values,
and sets the <iref bean changed> flag.<p>

Any or all of the bean's variables can be included; it is an error if the
dictionary contains keys which are not the names of instance variables.<p>

<b>Note:</b> it is not allowed to change the value of the bean's 
<code>id</code> variable; however, it <i>is</i> allowed to set it to its
existing value.  Thus, the following code is valid:<p>

<pre>
    $bean setdict [$bean getdict]
</pre>

This is often useful when undoing changes to a bean's state.<p>

<defitem subject {<i>bean</i> subject}>

By default, this method returns the empty string.  Subclasses can override
it to name the <xref notifier(n)> subject used for detailed notifications;
doing so enables these detailed notifications.<p>

<defitem update_ {<i>bean</i> update_ <i>varlist userdict</i>}>

This command is intended for use as an "update" mutator in orders.
It updates the bean's variables and returns an undo script that undoes
the change.<p>

The <i>varlist</i> is a list of bean variables to update.  The
<i>userdict</i> is a dictionary of variable names and values from the order.
For each variable in <i>varlist</i>, the command updates the variable given 
the matching value from <i>userdict</i>, if and only if:<p>

<ul>
    <li>There is a matching value in <i>userdict</i>
    <li>The value is not the empty string.
</ul>

In addition, the <i>userdict</i> can contain any number of other keys; these
are ignored.<p>

<ul>
<li> Call <iref onUpdate_>, which by default does nothing.
     Subclasses should override this method rather than <iref update_> 
     itself.<p>

<li> Send a detailed notifier event, if <iref subject> is defined:<p>
    <pre>$subject &lt;update&gt; $id</pre><p>

<li> Send a generic notifier event:<p>
    <pre>::bean &lt;Monitor&gt;</pre><p>
</ul>

The undo script will undo the change; it will also:<p>

<ul>
<li> Send a detailed notifier event, if <iref subject> is defined:<p>
    <pre>$subject &lt;update&gt; $id</pre><p>

<li> Send a generic notifier event:<p>
    <pre>::bean &lt;Monitor&gt;</pre><p>
</ul>

<defitem view {<i>bean</i> view ?<i>view</i>?}>

Returns the view dictionary for the requested <i>view</i> of the bean.
Every bean supports the default view dictionary, "", which is returned
if the view name is omitted.  See <xref "Bean Views"> for more 
information.<p>
