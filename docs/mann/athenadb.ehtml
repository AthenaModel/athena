<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require athena <version>
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

athenadb(n) is a Snit type whose instances represent entire Athena
scenarios.  It is the main type in the <xref athena(n)> library; 
creating an instance of athenadb(n) creates all of the other objects 
required by a scenario.  It is also a utility object for all objects in 
the scenario; it passes itself to all objects it creates, and they use it 
as the primary means of accessing other objects.<p>

athenadb(n) is a <b private> type, to be used only within the library code.
Note that <xref athena(n)>, the public interface to the library, is a thin
wrapper around athenadb(n), providing only the public operations.<p>

<section "COMMANDS">

This module defines the following commands:<p>

<deflist commands>

<defitem "athenadb create" {athenadb create <i name> <i filename> ?<i options...>?}>

Creates a new instance of athenadb(n) called <i name>, which becomes a 
Tcl command defined in the current scope; <iref athenadb create> returns
the fully-qualified form of the name.<p>

If the <i filename> isn't the empty string, it specifies the name of 
an <tt .adb> scenario file to load.  If the named file cannot be loaded, 
athenadb(n) will throw "<tt SCENARIO OPEN>".<p>

The following options may be used:<p>

<deflist options>

<defopt {-logcmd <i command>}>

Specifies the name of a <xref mars:logger(n)> object used to log the 
object's activities.  The last component of the <tt -subject> name 
is used as the log "component".<p>

<defopt {-subject <i name>}>

Specifies the subject <i name> used for any <xref mars:notifier(n)>
events sent by the object.  By default, the <i name> defaults to the
object's fully-qualified command name.<p>

For example, 
athenadb(n) wraps an <xref mars:sqldocument(n)> object used to contain
the scenario's run-time database (RDB).  When monitoring is enabled, the
RDB can generate <xref mars:notifier(n)> events as tables are updated.<p>

</deflist options>


<defitem "athenadb register" {athenadb register <i saveable>}>

Registers the name of an <xref mars:saveable(i)> command with Athena,
so that the command's data will be loaded and restored with the scenario
data.<p>

<b TODO>: Once all registered modules are part of the library, this must
become a private instance method; athenadb(n) will register all modules
as part of its initialization.<p>

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMAND">

Each athenadb(n) instance has the following subcommands:<p>

<deflist instance>

<defitem adbfile {<i adb> adbfile}>

Returns the name of the <tt .adb> file loaded on creation, if any, or
the <tt .adb> file name last used for saving, or "" if no <tt .adb> file
has ever been loaded or saved.<p>

<defitem eval {<i adb> eval <i query> ?<i args...>?}>

Evaluates an SQL <i query> with respect to the scenario's run-time 
database.  The arguments are as for the standard SQLite3 <tt eval>
subcommand.<p>

<defitem exists {<i adb> exists <i query>}>

Evaluates an SQL <i query> with respect to the scenario's run-time 
database, returning 1 if the result set contains at least one row,
and 0 otherwise.  The arguments are as for the standard SQLite3
<tt exists> subcommand.<p>

<defitem log {<i adb> log <i level message>}>

Given a <tt -logcmd>, logs the <i message> at the given <i level>,
e.g., "warning".<p>

<defitem monitor {<i adb> monitor <i args...>}>

This command is identical to the <xref mars:sqldocument(n)> object's
<xref mars:sqldocument(n) monitor> subcommand, allowing the control
of automatic monitoring of database changes.<p>

<defitem onecolumn {<i adb> onecolumn <i query>}>

Evaluates an SQL <i query> with respect to the scenario's run-time 
database, returning only the first column.<p>

<defitem query {<i adb> query <i query> ?<i options...>?}>

Evaluates an SQL <i query> with respect to the scenario's run-time 
database, and returns the result set as a formatted string.  The 
<i query> can contain any valid SQL statements understood by SQLite3,
but in practice it will be a single statemet that returns a result 
set (i.e., <tt SELECT> or certain <tt PRAGMA> statements).<p>

The following options may be used:<p>

<deflist query>

<defopt {-mode mc|list|csv}>

Specifies the output mode; the default is <b>mc</b>, multicolumn.<p>

When <tt -mode> is <b>mc</b>, each record is output on a single
line.  Fields are formatted in columns, with the field name as the
column header.<p>

When <tt -mode> is <b>list</b>, the output is a list of records.
Each record is output on multiple lines, with (nominally) one line
per field.  Each line consists of the field name and value; the
record's field names are values are formatted neatly in parallel columns.<p>

When <tt -mode> is <b>csv</b>, the output is in CSV (comma-separated value)
format, one record per line, beginning with a header record of column labels.
Non-numeric values are enclosed in double-quotes.<p>

<defopt {-labels <i>list</i>}>

Normally <iref query> uses the column names found in the query to
label the fields in the output.  If specified, the value of
<b>-labels</b> is a list of labels to be used instead.<p>

<defopt {-maxcolwidth <i>chars</i>}>

Sets the maximum column width, in characters, when <tt -mode> is
<b>mc</b>; the default is 30.  All
data values longer than this will be truncated with "...".<p>

If <b>-maxcolwidth</b> is set to 0 then values will not be
truncated.<p>

<defopt {-headercols <i>num</i>}>

Sets the number of header columns.  When <tt -mode> is <b>mc</b>,
repeated values in a column are skipped.  That is, if a column
contains identical values in consecutive rows, the column will be
blank in all but the first of the rows.  Defaults to "0".<p>

</deflist query>

<defitem "rdb component" {<i adb> rdb component}>

Returns the fully-qualified name of the instance's RDB handle, for direct
use by the wrapping <xref athena(n)> object.<p>

<b TODO>: At present, this is the same RDB handle used by athenadb(n) 
itself; ultimately, it will be a read-only SQLite3 handle accessing the
same RDB file and providing the same functions and temporary schema 
items.  This will allow <xref athena(n)> to provide safe access to 
clients.<p>


<defitem rebase {<i adb> rebase}>

Given a scenario with time advanced, this command converts it into a
scenario with the same data at time 0.  This is experimental.<p>

<defitem save {<i adb> save ?<i filename>?}>

Saves the scenario to disk as an <tt .adb> file called <i filename>,
adding the "<tt .adb>" extension if necessary.  On failure, throws
"<tt SCENARIO SAVE>".<p>

<defitem unsaved {<i adb> unsaved}>

Returns 1 if there is unsaved scenario data, and 0 otherwise.<p>

</deflist instance>

<section FUNCTIONS>

athena(n) defines many SQL functions for use in database queries.  The
functions are TBD.<p>
