<manpage {projectlib(n) mydomain(n)} "Basic mydomain(i) Handler">

<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require projectlib <version>
namespace import ::projectlib::mydomain
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

mydomain(n) is a basic <xref mydomain(i)> implementation.
The application creates an instance of mydomain(n) and registers
resources and resource handlers with it; it then registers the
instance with <xref myagent(n)>.  At that point, <xref myagent(n)>
clients like <xref mybrowser(n)> can query it.<p>

The only resources known to a newly created mydomain(n) are
<code>/urlhelp</code> and <code>/urlhelp/{url}</code>, which are used
to browse the set of resources known to the server.<p>

<section "CONTENT TYPES">

By default, mydomain(n) serves only the following content types<p>

<deflist ctypes>

<defitem text/html {text/html}>

HTML text.<p>

However, registered resource handlers can provide content in any
desired form; mydomain(n) doesn't care.<p>

</deflist>

<section "COMMANDS">

mydomain(n) provides the following commands for use by the
application.<p>

<deflist commands>

<defitem mydomain {mydomain <i>name</i> ?<i>option value...</i>?}>

Creates a new instance of mydomain(n) called <i>name</i>; returns the
fully-qualified command name.<p>

Instances of mydomain(n) take the following options:<p>

<deflist options>
<defopt {-domain <i domain>}>
<b Required.>  Specifies the object's domain, which must be a single
folder name beginning with "/", e.g., "<tt /app>" or "<tt /help>".<p>

<defopt {-logcmd <i>cmd</i>}>
Defines a command prefix to be called with three additional arguments
when the instance wishes to write to the debugging log: a verbosity
level, a module name, and a log message.  Note that <i>cmd</i> will
often be a <xref mars:logger(n)> instances.<p>

The most important thing logged by mydomain(n) are the requested URLs
and the time (in microseconds) required to produce the content.<p>

</deflist options>

</deflist commands>


<section "INSTANCE COMMANDS">

Instances of mydomain(n) provide the following subcommands for use by
the application.<p>

<deflist instance>

<defitem ctypes {$server ctypes <i>rtype</i>}>

Given a resource type name, <i>rtype</i>, returns a list of the
available content types.<p>

<defitem domain {$server domain}>

Returns the object's <tt -domain>.<p>

<defitem get {$server get <i>url</i> ?<i>contentTypes</i>?}>

<b>From <xref mydomain(i)>:</b> Retrieves the <i>url</i> from the
server.  If the <i>url</i> cannot be retrieved for any reason, the
server throws an error with error code <b>NOTFOUND</b>; the error
message is a human-readable message explaining why the resource cannot
be found.<p>

The <i>contentTypes</i> argument, if given, is a list of content types
accepted by the client.  Browse the server's <code>/urlhelp</code> resource
to see what URLs are accepted, and what content types they can
provide.  Custom content types should be documented by the application.<p>

If <i>contentTypes</i> is empty, the server will return the first
available content type for the requested <i>url</i>.  Otherwise, it
will return the first content type listed in <i>contentTypes</i> which
is available for the requested <i>url</i>.<p>

Note that the content types listed in <i>contentTypes</i> can include
wild cards, e.g., <b>text/*</b> and <b>*/*</b>.<p>

On success, the <iref get> command returns a dictionary with the
following keys:<p>

<deflist getdict>

<defitem url {url}>

The complete URL given to the server.  This is of interest because the
<xref myagent(n)> might have performed address resolution; hence,
the URL given to the server might not be the same as the URL given to
the agent.<p>

<defitem contentType {contentType}>

The content type of the returned content.<p>

<defitem content {content}>

The returned content itself.

</deflist>

<defitem register {$server register <i>rtype pattern ctype handler</i>
?<i>ctype handler...</i>? <i>doc</i>
}>

Registers (or re-registers) a resource type with the server; clients
can now query resources of this type.<p>

The <i>rtype</i> is the resource type name.  Resource type names are
arbitrary strings; conventionally, however, they mimic the associated
URL, beginning with a "/", and with placeholder parameter names in
curly brackets.  For example, the resource type for a piece of data
with a given ID might be

<pre>
    /data/{id}
</pre>

The <i>pattern</i> is a regular expression that matches the "path"
component of the resource's URL. It will be used as
"<code>^<i>pattern</i>$</code>" so
that it matches the entire path.  It should not begin with a
"/", as the leading slash is really a separator between the host name
and the path.<p>

The resource can be associated with multiple content types; each
<i>ctype</i> requires a <i>handler</i> to produce the content
associated with that <i>ctype</i>.  At least one <i>ctype</i> and
<i>handler</i> are required.<p>

Use standard MIME content types where possible (e.g.,
<code>text/html</code>, <code>text/plain</code>); for custom content
types containing Tcl-formatted data, use content type names like
<code>tcl/<i>name</i></code> or <code>tk/<i>name</i></code>.  The
application should document all custom content types.<p>

The <i>handler</i> should be a command prefix taking two additional
arguments, the <i>udict</i> and the <i>matchArray</i>.  The
<i>udict</i> is a dictionary of URL components for the URL used to query
the resource, as returned by <code>uri::split</code>, with the entire
<b>url</b> added.  The <i>matchArray</i> is the name of an 
array of pattern matches with indices 0 through 9.  Match 0 is the
entire path component of the URL; matchs 1 through 9 are submatches,
as determined by parentheses in the <i>pattern</i>.<p>

The handler must either return the desired content, or throw a
NOTFOUND error with a human-readable error message.<p>

<defitem resources {$server resources}>

Returns a list of the names of the registered resource types.<p>

</deflist instance>
