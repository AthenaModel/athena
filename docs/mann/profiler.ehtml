<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require projectlib 1.0
namespace import ::projectlib::*
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

<xref profiler(n)> allows the developer to dynamically instrument
routines of interest, and determine how many times they are being
called, and for how long, as an aid to performance optimization.  The
results should be interpreted with care, as the instrumentation adds
some performance overhead; e.g., if command A calls command B, and
both are instrumented, A's run-time will include the cost of B's
instrumentation.<p>

Use <iref profiler profile> to instrument a procedure, Snit
typemethod, or Snit instance method.  Use <iref profiler unprofile>
to de-instrument a procedure, or <iref profiler reset> to remove all
instrumentation.  Use <iref profiler dump> to dump the current
measurements, and <iref profiler clear> to delete them in
preparation for subsequent runs.<p>

<section COMMANDS>

This module defines the following commands:<p>

<deflist commands>

<defitem "profiler clear" {profiler clear}>

Clears all measurements, leaving a clean slate.<p>

<defitem "profiler dump" {profiler dump}>

Returns a dump of the current results.  The dump includes, for each
profiled command, the number of times it was called, and the total
time in microseconds.<p>

<defitem "profiler profile" {profiler profile <i>cmd</i> ?<i>subcmd...</i>?}>

Instruments the named command, which can be a procedure, a Snit
typemethod, or a Snit instance method.  For instance:<p>

<pre>
    # Procedure MyProc
    profiler profile MyProc

    # Typemethod "assess"
    profiler profile ::mytype assess

    # Instance method "compute"
    profiler profile $object compute
</pre>

Notice that when you profile an instance method, you're profiling that
method for all instances of the type, not just the object named in the
call.<p>

<defitem "profiler reset" {profiler reset}>

Resets the package, removing all measured results and de-instrumenting
all instrumented commands.<p>

<defitem "profiler unprofile" {profiler unprofile <i>cmd</i> ?<i>subcmd...</i>?}>

Removes the instrumentation on the specified command, which is named
as in <iref profiler profile>.<p>


</deflist commands>
