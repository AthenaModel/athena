<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require projectlib <version>
namespace import ::projectlib::myagent
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

In HTTP-parlance, a "user agent" is a program that accesses an HTTP
server.  An instance of myagent(n) is an object that clients can use
to access data from one or more <xref mydomain(i)> handlers within
the same application.  See <xref mydomain(i)> for information on
what a <xref mydomain(i)> is and why it is useful.

In addition, the myagent(n) type is responsible keeping track of the
available mydomain(i) instances.

<section COMMANDS>

<deflist commands>

<defitem myagent {myagent <i>name</i> ?<i>options...?</i>}>

Creates a new myagent(n) object called <i>name</i>. The object is
represented as a new Tcl command in the caller's scope;
<iref myagent> returns the fully-qualified form of the
<i>name</i>.

Before the new myagent(n) can be used, at least one
<xref mydomain(i)> must be registered using
<iref myagent register>.

The myagent(n) may be created with the following options:

<deflist options>

<defopt {-contenttypes <i>list</i>}>

Specifies the list of content types acceptable to this client, e.g.,
<b>text/html</b>.  Wildcards may be used, e.g., <b>text/*</b>.  This
list will be passed to the mydomain(i) along with the requested URL;
the server will only respond with an acceptable content type.

The mydomain(i) must document the content types it is capable of
returning.  Usually it will do so dynamically as <b>text/html</b> at the
address <tt>/urlhelp</tt>.

</deflist options>

<defitem "myagent register" {myagent register <i>handler</i>}>

Registers a <xref mydomain(i)> object so that it can be accessed by
instances of myagent(n).  The <i handler> is the actual
object.  By convention, an application's
main domains are <b>/app</b> and <b>/help</b>.

<defitem "myagent resolve" {myagent resolve <i>base url</i>}>

Given a <i>base</i> URL and some other <i>url</i>, possibly relative,
this command resolves the two into a single <i>url</i>.  For example,
given <tt>/app/group</tt> and <tt>BLUE</tt>, this command will
return <tt>/app/group/BLUE</tt>.  If the <i>url</i> were
<tt>/app/nbhood/N1</tt>, the returned URL would be
<tt>/app/nbhood/N1</tt> instead.

The client should always use this command (or, equivalently,
the instance's <iref resolve> subcommand) on all links embedded in
returned content, where <i>base</i> is the URL of the returned content
as a whole.

</deflist commands>

<section "INSTANCE COMMAND">

Each instance of myagent(n) has the following subcommands:

<deflist instance>

<defitem resolve {<i>object</i> resolve <i>base url</i>}>

This is identical to <iref myagent resolve>; it is provided for
convenience.

<defitem find {<i>object</i> find <i>url</i>}>

Validates the <i url>, verifying its syntax and that its domain is
known to the agent.  Returns a list, {<i domain> <i newurl>}, where
the <i domain> is the domain extracted from the <i url>, e.g., "<tt /app>",
and the <i newurl> is the <i url> in canonical form.

<defitem get {<i>object</i> get <i>url</i> ?<i>contentTypes</i>?}>

Retrieves the <i>url</i>'s content.  If the URL cannot be retrieved, the
command will throw an error with error code <i>NOTFOUND</i>; the error
message will indicate the reason for the error.

If present, the <i>url</i>'s scheme must be "<b my:>".

If one or more <i>contentTypes</i> are given, the returned content will
have the first available content type in the list; if none of the the
requested content types are available, the server will
throw <b>NOTFOUND</b>.  If <i>contentTypes</i> is not given, it
defaults to the value of the <code>-contenttypes</code> option.
