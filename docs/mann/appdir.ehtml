<section SYNOPSIS>

<pre>
package require projectlib 1.0
namespace import ::projectlib::*
</pre>

<itemlist>

<section DESCRIPTION>

<xref appdir(n)> is responsible for locating the directory from which
Athena is running, and making it available to the application.
At start-up, Athena calls <iref appdir init>, which locates and
returns the directory; thereafter, <iref appdir join> can be
used to create absolute paths to files in the application directory
tree.<p>

<section "COMMANDS">

This module defines the following commands:<p>

<deflist commands>

<defitem "appdir init" {appdir init}>

Initializes appdir(n).  In particular, it determines, saves,
and returns the full path to the application directory.<p>

<defitem "appdir join" {appdir join ?<i>arg arg...</i>?}>

Called with no arguments, returns the name of the application directory.
Otherwise, returns the path name resulting from joining the
arguments to the application directory.  For example, the
following command returns the absolute path of the on-line
help file:<p>

<pre>
set helpfile [appdir join docs help athena.helpdb]
</pre>

</deflist commands>
