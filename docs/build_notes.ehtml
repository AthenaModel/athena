<h3>Build 6.2.2-B16, 11 August 2014</h3>

This build adds the first version of the integrated Intel Ingestion Wizard,
which replaces the standalone athena_ingest(1) tool.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4568: athena(1): Added intel ingestion wizard
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.2.2-B15, 5 August 2014</h3>
This build integrates some of the sim events that were created for DCGS-A as 
proper rule sets with associated ABSITs.  It also introduces "abstract events"
or ABEVENT for short.  An ABEVENT is meant to be used to model a phenomenon that
is abstract but does not have ongoing effects in the simulation.  An example 
of an ABEVENT would be an ACCIDENT.  ABSITs can now be executed as
part of an actor's strategy now using the ABSIT tactic.  There is no mechanism,
yet, to execute an ABEVENT, only rule sets.  The complete list of packages:<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4558: athena(1): ABSIT tactic
<li> Bug 4560: athena(1): DROUGHT and TRAFFIC rule sets
<li> Bug 4561: athena(1): abstract event rule sets
<li> Bug 4562: athena(1): Abtract Event Tactics
<li> Bug 4563: athena(1): Wizard state 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.2.1-B14, 24 June 2014</h3>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4556: CURSE tactics with empty gofers in all injects should execute trivially
<li> Bug 4554: Ingestion script fails for DEMO events with multiple groups
<li> Bug 4555: DEMO curse skips demonstrating group 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.2.1-B13, 24 June 2014</h3>

A few bugs were found during testing of the previous build that requires a
new build be made. Here are the fixes:<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4433: activity.*.coverage help pages mention "active personnel"
<li> Bug 4438: CMO needs to be removed from documentation
<li> Bug 4446: Gini coefficient typos
<li> Bug 4531: nbcoop.<lb>g<rb> map fill bgerror
<li> Bug 4553: User is unable to edit the list of groups in Demonstration event 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.2.1-B12, 23 June 2014</h3>

This build contains mainly some bug fixes and represents a potential candidate
for use at the I2WD demonstration in July.  There is one new event type for
athena_ingest(1) called "DEMO" and is meant to simulate a non-violent 
demonstration occurring in Athena.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 4447: athena(1): no tests for autogen executive commands
  <li> Bug 4530: athena(1): CURSE help pages don't match code

</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.2.1-B11, 18 June 2014</h3>

This build adds a new gofer(n) rule for CIVGROUPS called "megafilter".
It essentially rolls up all other rules into a single rule that allows the user
to pick and choose which filtering to apply to a list of civilian groups.  It 
may, in the future, be a rule applied to all of Athena's entities and could, in
principle, replace all other gofer(n) rules.  There is also a few bug fixes
to athena_ingest(1) and athena(1).<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4505: athena(1): CURSE tactic execution results in too many rule firings.
<li> Bug 4526: athena(1): add hist_service_g table to history.

<li> Bug 4527: athena_ingest(1): enabled/disabled state is ignored.
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.2.0-B7, 28 May 2014</h3>
A serious bug was found in the athena_ingest(1) application that requires a
new build.  This build has a fix for that and a couple of other bugs:<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4492: pcf map fill bgerror
<li> Bug 4517: CURSE Injects do not require unique role names
<li> Bug 4519: athena_ingest(1): bgerror, cannot find ingest_support.tcl 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.2.0-B6, 27 May 2014</h3>
This build contains a number of key fixes to the athena_ingest(1) tool. There's
also a few bug fixes. The list of packages:<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4513: Econ / Groups tab does not output Consumption data

<li> Bug 4515: athena_ingest(1): Enhancements 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.2.0-B5, 22 May 2014</h3>
This build is the first to contain new enhancements specific to the DCGS-A
data ingestion effort.  Specifically, a new Athena application called 
athena_ingest(1) can be used to import DCGS-A TIGR messages.  The messages can
then be allocated to certain types of predetermined events.  Finally the 
events can be converted to an order script containing certain kinds of tactics
that simulate the effects of the events on the entities in the scenario.  For
this build, the focus is on Afghanistan. As such, there is an Afghanistan
scenario and a set of Afghanistan based TIGR messages available for use in 
testing, ask a developer.  There is also some changes to how the economic 
model is enabled and disabled.  A new tab under the Economics tab allows the
user to easily switch the model on and off.  TRISA requested that the CONSUMP
and UNEMP rulesets fire when Econ is disabled.  There's some other enhancements
as well.<p>

</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.2.0-B4, 29 April 2014</h3>
At the request of TRISA, this build represents the first in a new build
numbering scheme.  This will allow future releases of Athena to be deployed
in the field quicker. Essentially, the build number is appended to the future 
version of Athena.  So this is build 4 of version 6.2.0 of Athena to be 
released at a future date.  This build contains a number of changes to simplify
the map UI.  There are also some minor transparent changes to the wmsclient(n)
API that do not change the functionality but make the interface more robust.   
There is also a few bug fixes.<p>

<ul>

<h3>Build 7.0.3, 17 April 2014</h3>
This build contains a Web Map Service (WMS) client that acts like an order
dialog that allows the user to pick and choose a geo-referenced map from an
Open GIS compliant WMS server.  This is a general capability but should be 
useful in the DCGS-A environment as well.  There is also some more GUI 
simplification and added helps for the new belief system.<p>

<h3>Build 6.0.10, 6 February 2014</h3>
This build contains a complete retooling of the layout of Athena's tabs to
be in line with the PMESII-PT acronym.  Thus you will see tabs titled:
"Political", "Military", "Economics", "Social", "Infrastructure", and 
"Information" to correspond to the first part of this acronym.  There are
also tabs for "Physical" and "Time" that correspond to the last part.  The
"Detail" tab and "Strategy" tab are on their own since they cross-cut so much
of all areas.  There is one significant new feature in this build: 
unemployment is now disaggregated to neighborhoods according to the amount
of production infrastructure present.  Part of this algorithm includes
computing those in the labor force that are geographically unemployed since 
they are unwilling to go a parameter controlled distance to get to work.  
This number is fed back into the CGE on the next tock and further impacts 
the economy.  There are a host of bug fixes in the build as well.<p>

<h3>Build 6.0.8, 12 December 2013</h3>

This build contains some significant changes to how the MAINTAIN tactic
operates.  The analyst specifies repair modes instead of spending modes and 
then Athena spends according to best efforts to maintain the infrastructure
as instructed.  There's also a few bug fixes to the infrastrucuture model.
There are some new NUMBER gofer(n) rules and a new export capability that
exports the state of Athena rather than the history.  This should make it
easier for the end user when moving from one version of Athena to another and
when declassifying scenarios.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4262: athena(1): ECON:* order help pages
<li> Bug 4269: Small values for bktsPerYear yields negative number of plants
<li> Bug 4270: repair level of zero causes bgerror

<li> Bug 4278: athena(1): Need to implement gofer::NUMBER 'coverage' rule & executive function.
<li> Bug 4271: athena(1): Strategy executive commands
<li> Bug 4272: help(5): optionlist, option macros
<li> Bug 4273: athena(1): Minimal Scenario export script
<li> Bug 4282: htools(n): "pretty" tables
<li> Bug 4280: athena(1): Use pretty tables in help(5) 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.7, 6 December 2013</h3>

This build has some quite notable new functionality.  The second part of
the manufacturing infrastructure has been implemented.  This means that
the infrastructure now degrades with time if the new MAINTAIN tactic is not
used by an actor to keep it from going into disrepair.  Note that you can
disable the degradation of infrastructure (and thus the need to MAINTAIN it)
by not allocating any of it to actors and let the SYSTEM agent own it all.
The economic model will be impacted if the infrastructure is allowed to degrade
too far.  Cut/Copy/Paste is implemented for Blocks, Conditions and Tactics!
This means that you can cut and copy any part (or all) of one actors strategy
and paste it.  Once pasted, editing can then take place to
make possibly invalid blocks valid.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4248: athena(1): remove econ.idleFrac from application
<li> Bug 4250: athena(1): remove econcapbrowser(n) from application
<li> Bug 4260: athena(1): Manufacturing Plant Infrastructure, part II
<li> Bug 4247: athena(1): Implement needed gopher::NUMBER rule "security" and update it's executive function.
<li> Bug 4244: athena(1): Tactic Cut/Copy/Paste
<li> Bug 4249: athena(1): Condition Cut/Copy/Paste

<li> Bug 4259: athena(1): Mark II Strategy help pages
<li> Bug 4261: athena(1): STRATEGY:* help pages
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.6, 2 December 2013</h3>

This build contains the first part of the manufacturing infrastructure model.
Manufacturing plants can be allocated to actors and neighborhoods.  The econ
model uses the capacity computed by the infrastructure model as the capacity
of the goods sector.  There's a few bug fixes and some code cleanup in a 
couple of the Mark II tactics.  The built in script editor now has better
syntax checking.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4243: athena(1): Manufacturing Plant Infrastructure, part I
<li> Bug 4220: Actors and System Agent share tactic lists
<li> Bug 4221: athena(1): gofer::NBHOODS not returning nbhoods properly
<li> Bug 4234: athena(1): Require tablelist 5.10
<li> Bug 4235: athena(1): Cleanup BROADCAST tactic
<li> Bug 4238: athena(1): initial tclchecker(n) integration

<li> Bug 4236: 	athena(1): Cleanup FUND tactic tests 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.5, 18 November 2013</h3>

This build contains the last tactic to be converted to the Mark II Strategy
Engine: ASSIGN.  It also contains some new deployment modes for the DEPLOY 
tactic, some bug fixes to the new strategy engine and a few minor 
enhancements.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4208: SPEND tactic displays $amt instead of numerical value
<li> Bug 4209: FUND tactic help page is missing actor
<li> Bug 4219: Hook ID does not require unique value
<li> Bug 4222: athena(1): have export command write the version of Athena used for export
<li> Bug 4225: athena(1): expose the pfactor attribute in the nbhood object
<li> Bug 4213: athena(1): Mark II ASSIGN Tactic
<li> Bug 4215: Tactic undo redo bgerror
<li> Bug 4218: athena(1): Mark II DEPLOY Tactic, Part II

<li> Bug 4231: athena(1): Make tactic sanity check failures consistent 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.4, 7 November 2013</h3>

This build contains what is likely that last major update to the Mark II 
Strategy Engine.  Most of the work is complete, but there's a few loose ends
that will be tied up in later builds.  There is now a new neighborhoods 
gofer and some bug fixes as well.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4154: athena(1): update autogen to create new-style strategies.
<li> Bug 4205: athena(1): Mark II BROADCAST Tactic
<li> Bug 4212: athena(1): Mark II STANCE Tactic

<li> Bug 4216: undo causes error when referencing deleted objects
<li> Bug 4217: athena(1): Mark II DEPLOY Tactic
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.3, 28 October 2013</h3>

This build contains wholesale changes to the Mark II Strategy Engine that 
includes the addition of many more tactics and some changes to how some of 
the tactics are specified.  There are more robust ways of specifying how an
actor spends his money on certain tactics.  Some of the tactics have been
updated to user gofer(n) objects to retrieve list of entities from Athena
upon tactic execution.<p>

Spend as much time as is necessary to vet each of the revamped tactics. The
on-line help for all the implemented tactics should be available to aid in
testing.<p>

<ul>

<h3>Build 6.0.2, 3 October 2013</h3>

This build contains the preliminary version of the Mark II Strategy Engine.
Only two conditions and a subset of the tactics have been converted to the
new engine; the remainder are unavailable in this version.<p>

The focus in this version should be on testing strategy editing, and execution
of the tactics that currently exist.  There are new Detail Browser pages, and
similar content in the Strategy/Editor tab that needs to be examined for
anomalies.  Anything that's unclear or peculiar looking should be reported.<p>

The on-line help has not yet been updated.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4147: athena(1): change the units of production in the black sector to blackBKT
<li> Bug 4148: Mark II Strategy Engine Preliminaries
<li> Bug 4153: Mark II Strategy Engine Installed
<li> Bug 4156: athena(1): Multiple item delete in Strategy/Editor
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.1, 25 September 2013</h3>
This build contains some enhancements to the SAM and CGE in the econ model.
Specifically, the SAM now takes remittances as a direct input and balances
the goods and pop sectors on lock by assuming any difference in total 
expenditures and total revenue in those sectors is aggregate savings (which
could be negative). The CGE now takes total geographic unemployment (GU) into
consideration when computing an equilibrium. The CGE also now has inputs
for price and wage indices for use by a future inflation model. There's also
an enhancement to how Athena produces a bgerror.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4135: athena(1): implement geographic unemployment
<li> Bug 4136: athena(1): introduce aggregate savings to balance goods and pop sectors in SAM
<li> Bug 4137: athena(1): CGE 'M' page should take into account geographic unemployment
<li> Bug 4140: athena(1): add price/wage index to CGE and econ tab
<li> Bug 4142: Update helps with new econ stuff
<li> Bug 4143: athena_test(1): test failures due to GU in the CGE
<li> Bug 4144: athena_test(1): test failures due to cell name change in CGE
<li> Bug 4145: athena(1): TACTIC:FUND:UPDATE order has wrong title
<li> Bug 4146: athena(1): provide a context stack trace on bgerror 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.0, 9 September 2013</h3>

This is the initial 6.0.x baseline; it is based on the same code as
Athena 5.1.0.<p>
