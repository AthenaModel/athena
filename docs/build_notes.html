<h1>Athena Build Notes</h1>
    

<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 6.3.3, 19 October 2015</h3>
<p>This is the release build for Athena 6.3.3. It is identical to 6.3.3a1 
except for the version number and these build notes.

</p>

<h3>Build 6.3.3a1, 12 October 2015</h3>
<p>This build is the 6.3.3 release candidate and contains one bug fix and an
update to the copyright notice in anticipation of Athena's open sourcing.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #320: long latlong strings cause Athena to crash
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.1, 28 September 2015</h3>
<p>This build is the 6.3.1 release candidate and contains the completed
documentation set and one minor change to the MOOD ruleset as requested by
TRADOC G-27.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #314: Remove some VREL effects from MOOD ruleset 
</li><li> Issue #310: Remove unnecessary step from CM plan 
</li><li> Issue #309: Help order scrub 
</li><li> Issue #308: broken links in help 
</li><li> Issue #260: athena(1): Man page update needed 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.1a4, 17 September 2015</h3>
<p>This build contains a few bug fixes and some new vardiffs for causality 
chaining.  The Athena Help has had some restructuring done to it.  There's
also documentation updates.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #307: New vardiff: influence.n.a
</li><li> Issue #306: NOT_CONTROLLED_BY gofer does not return correct list of nbhoods
</li><li> Issue #305: chainbrowser: baseline vs excursion analysis 
</li><li> Issue #304: Make security.n.g a primary vardiff
</li><li> Issue #303: New vardiff: saliency.g.c enhancement
</li><li> Issue #302: WMS client sends incorrect order parm 
</li><li> Issue #301: export error: invalid command name "parm"
</li><li> Issue #299: Athena Help Restructuring
</li><li> Issue #298: compdb active parameters do not disable the variable
</li><li> Issue #297: Arachne needs -compdb comand line parameter 
</li><li> Issue #286: MAG Nbmood equation 
</li><li> Issue #169: athena(n) background threads need mods too
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.1a3, 26 August 2015</h3>
<p>This build introduces the Analysis Tab in the Athena Workbench and History
request pages in the Athena Test Web App.  Comparison parameter database
(compdb(5)) files are now managed by the workbench.  The help pages have 
been updated to show what the parameters are and how you can change and 
export them.  The Web App still needs to have a way to read in a comparison
parameter database so, for now, it will still use the defaults.  A couple 
of old bugs that did not get assigned milestones are included here even 
though they were fixed in a previous build; they may still need to be tested.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #296: bgerror: compdb parameters not loaded properly 
</li><li> Issue #295: Introduced compdb commands in workbench
</li><li> Issue #294: Analysis Tab
</li><li> Issue #293: Add significance coefficents to compdb(5) 
</li><li> Issue #292: Angular hist
</li><li> Issue #278: remove huddle requirements from Athena
</li><li> Issue #277: Web App: case tabs are unresponsive
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.1a2, 27 July 2015</h3>
<p>This build contains some updates to Arachne and the Web App.  There is a
page for each case that can be used to display and filter model 
parameters and to change model parameter values.  There is also a comparison 
page that can be used to compare the same scenario at different times or 
two different scenarios.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #285: New vardiff scoring
</li><li> Issue #284: Uniform Vardiff Scoring 
</li><li> Issue #283: Web App: Comparisons, Part II Arachne enhancement 
</li><li> Issue #282: Webapp comparison two
</li><li> Issue #281: Web App: Comparisons, Part I Arachne enhancement 
</li><li> Issue #280: Webapp comparisons, Part I
</li><li> Issue #279: Arachne parms
</li><li> Issue #276: Web App: Arachne service extensions 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.1a1, 7 July 2015</h3>
<p>This build introduces a new Arachne web app based upon AngularJS, a third 
party Javascript library that allows for quick construction and easier software
management of web-based applications. One of the biggest benefits of using
AngularJS is that the web app uses the same JSON interface that any other
web app would use (ie. the Federal CGI contractor). This means that the
JSON interface can be verified directly.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #274: Web App: case object management
</li><li> Issue #273: Web App: case lock, unlock, advance
</li><li> Issue #271: arachne.css: definition list display
</li><li> Issue #269: Arachne: URL Schema display in web app
</li><li> Issue #268: Arachne Comparisons 
</li><li> Issue #266: vardiffs drilldown: support 
</li><li> Issue #265: vardiffs drilldown: vrel 
</li><li> Issue #264: vardiff drilldowns: pbmood, pbsat, nbmood, nbsat, bsysmood, bsyssat
</li><li> Issue #262: Need groups by belief system in stats(n) module 
</li><li> Issue #272: Arachne log page
</li><li> Issue #270: Arachne URL Schemas in new Debug Interface
</li><li> Issue #267: Arachne comparison
</li><li> Issue #261: Angular athena
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.0, 17 June 2015</h3>
<p>This build is the release candidate for Athena 6.3 and contains only two
small bug fixes.

<h3>Build 6.3.0a10, 1 June 2015</h3>
<p>This build contains the latest addition to the family of applications that 
use the athena(n) library: Arachne.  Arachne is a webserver that provides
access to web pages to create, update, query and run an instance of athena
by way of a standard web browser (ie. Chrome, Firefox, etc...).  There is
also a number of bug fixes.

</li><li> Issue #146: athena(1) no longer needs a batch mode. 
</li><li> Issue #137: Athena Help: misformatted page headers
</li></ul>


<h3>Build 6.3.0a9, 28 April 2015</h3>
<p>This build contains a fix to a significant bug and a minor refactor to how
history is stored.  Athena should now run in the background without issue.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #170: History refactoring
</li><li> Issue #167: bgerror: Athena won't run in background thread
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.0a8, 23 April 2015</h3>
<p>This build contains updated CIVCAS rules for HREL and VREL effects.  There 
is now a progress bar at the top of the Athena Workbench that appears after the
run button is pressed to show runtime progress and disappears when the run
is complete.  Since the Athena backend library has come into being and is
completely separate from the frontend GUI , the library can now be run in its
own thread.  For now, the target for running Athena in a background thread is 
the Arachne case, but the workbench will at some point be updated to use this
capability.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #166: athenawb(1): mod loader error reporting is broken
</li><li> Issue #165: concern for civilian casualties not changing
</li><li> Issue #164: New CIVCAS rules
</li><li> Issue #163: athena(n): Background Processing
</li><li> Issue #161: AAM needs some parmdb defaults
</li><li> Issue #154: athenawb(1): Add progress bar enhancement
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.0a7, 15 April 2015</h3>
<p>This build changes the name of the Athena front end GUI to "Athena Workbench".
The name of the executable is now athenawb.exe on Windows and athenawb
on Linux. From a Windows user's standpoint, nothing has changed; the same 
Athena icon is what is double clicked to launch the Athena GUI.  The build
also contains the implementation of AAM as laid out in the model memo. There
is two new tactics: ROE and HIDE.  Athena Workbench has new detail browser
pages for tracking combat within AAM.  A one-year moving average for GDP 
within the economics model is now computed by Athena and displayed on the
Economics/Overview tab.  There are a few bug fixes as well.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #159: Moving Average GDP Calculation
</li><li> Issue #158: athenawb(1): Log tab, -autowidth
</li><li> Issue #157: bgerror on time advance after loading a paused scenario
</li><li> Issue #156: combat appserver page bgerror
</li><li> Issue #155: Appserver combat
</li><li> Issue #153: Hide tactic and visibility factors
</li><li> Issue #152: New aam
</li><li> Issue #150: Add deployment history table
</li><li> Issue #149: Athena tool
</li><li> Issue #148: Athena workbench
</li><li> Issue #143: Popup cancel bgerror 
</li><li> Issue #142: Beanbrowsers need to have an option for the beanpot 
</li><li> Issue #140: Autogen scenario does not clear old neighborhood polygons 
</li><li> Issue #138: athena(n): cannot create two instances 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.0a6, 9 March 2015</h3>
<p>This build contains more changes related to the re-architecture of Athena. As
of this build, the re-architecture can be considered feature complete unless
some unforeseen problem arises.  There are a few bug fixes and enhancements
included with this build.  However, most of the testing of this build should be 
centered on regresssion testing.

<h3>Build 6.3.0a5, 19 February 2015</h3>
<p>This build contains a whole host of architectural changes to many modules
in Athena (Issue #64 below).  This continues our effort to have many instances
of Athena running as a library.  These changes require a significant amount of 
regression testing be done to ensure that the architectural changes are 
transparent to the user. There are also a number of bug fixes.

</p>

<ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.0a4, 28 January 2015</h3>
<p>This build contains a very significant number of changes related to the
re-architecture of Athena for use as a web application running in the cloud
to support Corps level COA analysis.  Specifically, Athena had to be changed
to allow for multiple instances of scenarios. Which means each instance needs 
it's own order processing and own set of scenario objects including instances
of strategies for each actor in each scenario.  These changes will make it
possible (along with others yet to be done) for the Athena application to 
run as a library with, for example, a browser-based front end controlling it.  
Another change of note is the addition of user defined block, tactic and
condition names that can be used in orders instead of numeric IDs, which is
cumbersome for the user.  There is quite a few bug fixes as well.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #63: Mars Order Processor integration
</li><li> Issue #62: New Order Infrastructure, plus updated orders 
</li><li> Issue #61: Paste of blocks, tactics and conditions not undoable
</li><li> Issue #60: Add history tables 
</li><li> Issue #57: Strategy names can now be used in orders

</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.0a3, 19 November 2014</h3>
<p>This build contains updated rule sets for the Abstract Infrastructure services
and a few bug fixes.  The most notable change to the rule sets is the added
effect to vertical relationship with the controlling actor (if there is one).

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #31: Neighborhood Abstract Infrastructure Services table is redundant
</li><li> Issue #30: Update project file to exclude unnecessary packages 
</li><li> Issue #29: Updated abstract infrastructure rule sets
</li><li> Issue #28: ALOS needs to be capped
</li><li> Issue #27: FUNDENI tactics should set ALOS on lock
</li><li> Issue #23: app_athena test failure: 020-NBHOOD, CREATE_RAW-1.12 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.0a2, 5 November 2014</h3>
<p>This build contains more abstract services: WATER and TRANSPORT. The rules 
still need to be scrubbed, for now the magnitudes of the effects are identical
to the ENERGY abstract infrastructure.  The detail browser for neighborhoods
and groups should show the new abstract services.  There's also some 
documentation updates and some transparent changes to how Athena applications
are loaded at startup.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue #25: FUNDENI tactics should be able to have uncapped spending
</li><li> Issue #22: Add TRANSPORT abstract infrastructure service 
</li><li> Issue #20: athena(1) and cellide(1) should use standard loader scripts 
</li><li> Issue #19: Add WATER abstract infrastructure service
</li><li> Issue #18: Add appserver pages for abstract services
</li><li> Issue #18: Installer file should reference the full name of the executable.
</li><li> Issue #16: CM plan should no longer mention manual build of athena.helpdb
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.3.0a1, 21 October 2014</h3>
<p>This build is the first build to use the new 'kite' project system. From a
users point of view the only change is the way version numbers are represented.
However, the GIT repository is where testers should now go to view 'issues'
instead of bugs to see details about the things that have gone into a build.
This build contains the first of a handful of what we are calling Abstract
Infrastructure Services (AIS). The first one being the ENERGY service.  A user
can use the new SERVICE tactic (SYSTEM agent only) to change the actual level
of ENERGY service received by a neighborhood(s).  All the civilian groups 
resident in the neighborhood(s) are then affected.  NOTE: the rule set in
this build should be considered a place holder until the actual magnitudes
are determined.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Issue 15: Add ENERGY abstract infrastrucure service
</li><li> Issue 12: Move docs/help to src/help
</li><li> Issue 11: Add distribution sets to project.kite 
</li><li> Issue 10: app_athena should not include packages that projectlib does
</li><li> Issue 9: Separate the ENI specific functionality from the service module
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.2.2-B23, 7 October 2014</h3>
<p>This build is the release candidate for Athena 6.2.2.  It contains
documentation updates to the AAG, AUG and online help.  It also restores the
accidentally removed "Help" menu in main window menu bar.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4612: Add online help page for Wizards

<p>This build has mainly documentation updates but also contains a couple of bug fixes.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4603: broken links on scenariodb(n) man page
</li><li> Bug 4607: Athena Map Scrollbars should not scroll
</li><li> Bug 4609: Make neighborhood ingestion wizard header more compact

<h3>Build 6.2.2-B20, 16 September 2014</h3>
<p>This build contains an enhancement to the Neighborhood Ingestion wizard that
allows the user to configure neighborhoods via a home-brewed text file.  The
idea is that, in the absence of the World Database, this would serve as a
proxy to describe things like neighborhood heirarchy.  There are also some
bug fixes to that wizard and some other bug fixes to Athena proper.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4598: Neighborhood Ingestion Wizard not consistent with Athena Playbox

<h3>Build 6.2.2-B16, 11 August 2014</h3>
<p>This build adds the first version of the integrated Intel Ingestion Wizard,
which replaces the standalone athena_ingest(1) tool.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4568: athena(1): Added intel ingestion wizard
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.2.2-B15, 5 August 2014</h3>
<p>This build integrates some of the sim events that were created for DCGS-A as 
proper rule sets with associated ABSITs.  It also introduces "abstract events"
or ABEVENT for short.  An ABEVENT is meant to be used to model a phenomenon that
is abstract but does not have ongoing effects in the simulation.  An example 
of an ABEVENT would be an ACCIDENT.  ABSITs can now be executed as
part of an actor's strategy now using the ABSIT tactic.  There is no mechanism,
yet, to execute an ABEVENT, only rule sets.  The complete list of packages:

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4558: athena(1): ABSIT tactic
</li><li> Bug 4560: athena(1): DROUGHT and TRAFFIC rule sets
</li><li> Bug 4561: athena(1): abstract event rule sets
</li><li> Bug 4562: athena(1): Abtract Event Tactics
</li><li> Bug 4563: athena(1): Wizard state 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.2.1-B14, 24 June 2014</h3>
<p>Three more bug fixes related to athena_ingest(1) testing are in this build. 

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4556: CURSE tactics with empty gofers in all injects should execute trivially
</li><li> Bug 4554: Ingestion script fails for DEMO events with multiple groups
</li><li> Bug 4555: DEMO curse skips demonstrating group 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.2.1-B13, 24 June 2014</h3>
<p>A few bugs were found during testing of the previous build that requires a
new build be made. Here are the fixes:

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4433: activity.*.coverage help pages mention "active personnel"
</li><li> Bug 4438: CMO needs to be removed from documentation
</li><li> Bug 4446: Gini coefficient typos
</li><li> Bug 4531: nbcoop.&lt;g&gt; map fill bgerror
</li><li> Bug 4553: User is unable to edit the list of groups in Demonstration event 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.2.1-B12, 23 June 2014</h3>
<p>This build contains mainly some bug fixes and represents a potential candidate
for use at the I2WD demonstration in July.  There is one new event type for
athena_ingest(1) called "DEMO" and is meant to simulate a non-violent 
demonstration occurring in Athena.

</p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 4447: athena(1): no tests for autogen executive commands
  </li><li> Bug 4530: athena(1): CURSE help pages don't match code
  </li><li> Bug 4550: autogen bsystem is invalid

  </li><li> Bug 4541: NON_SA_IN CIVGROUPS gofer help page is inconsistent
  </li><li> Bug 4551: athena_ingest(1): DEMO sim event 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.2.1-B11, 18 June 2014</h3>
<p>This build adds a new gofer(n) rule for CIVGROUPS called "megafilter".
It essentially rolls up all other rules into a single rule that allows the user
to pick and choose which filtering to apply to a list of civilian groups.  It 
may, in the future, be a rule applied to all of Athena's entities and could, in
principle, replace all other gofer(n) rules.  There is also a few bug fixes
to athena_ingest(1) and athena(1).

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4505: athena(1): CURSE tactic execution results in too many rule firings.
</li><li> Bug 4526: athena(1): add hist_service_g table to history.
</li><li> Bug 4540: Role names can be assigned to conflicting role types

</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.2.1-B10, 9 June 2014</h3>
<p>This build contains a bug fix for the TRAFFIC ingestion event, and
some preliminary infrastructure to support the upcoming DEMO
ingestion event.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4542: projectlib(n): Add "listbutton" dynaform field type

<h3>Build 6.2.1-B8, 3 June 2014</h3>
<p>This build contains a number of bug fixes to 6.2.0-B7's ingestion
tool.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4516: Help page refers to Athena 7
</li><li> Bug 4520: Athena Ingest sorting messages right click
</li><li> Bug 4521: Athena Ingest html page typo
</li><li> Bug 4522: Athena Ingest save script does not add .tcl extension

</li><li> Bug 4524: Athena Ingest UNIQUE constraint failed error
</li><li> Bug 4525: Athena Ingest save script problem
</li><li> Bug 4527: athena_ingest(1): enabled/disabled state is ignored.
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.2.0-B7, 28 May 2014</h3>
<p>A serious bug was found in the athena_ingest(1) application that requires a
new build.  This build has a fix for that and a couple of other bugs:

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4492: pcf map fill bgerror
</li><li> Bug 4517: CURSE Injects do not require unique role names
</li><li> Bug 4519: athena_ingest(1): bgerror, cannot find ingest_support.tcl 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.2.0-B6, 27 May 2014</h3>
<p>This build contains a number of key fixes to the athena_ingest(1) tool. There's
also a few bug fixes. The list of packages:

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4513: Econ / Groups tab does not output Consumption data
</li><li> Bug 4463: Clicking the X in the "Are you Sure?" dialog does not cancel
</li><li> Bug 4472: Mouse scroll wheel does not scroll on Detail browser pages

</li><li> Bug 4514: athena_ingest(1): TIGR Retrieval page improvements
</li><li> Bug 4515: athena_ingest(1): Enhancements 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.2.0-B5, 22 May 2014</h3>
<p>This build is the first to contain new enhancements specific to the DCGS-A
data ingestion effort.  Specifically, a new Athena application called 
athena_ingest(1) can be used to import DCGS-A TIGR messages.  The messages can
then be allocated to certain types of predetermined events.  Finally the 
events can be converted to an order script containing certain kinds of tactics
that simulate the effects of the events on the entities in the scenario.  For
this build, the focus is on Afghanistan. As such, there is an Afghanistan
scenario and a set of Afghanistan based TIGR messages available for use in 
testing, ask a developer.  There is also some changes to how the economic 
model is enabled and disabled.  A new tab under the Economics tab allows the
user to easily switch the model on and off.  TRISA requested that the CONSUMP
and UNEMP rulesets fire when Econ is disabled.  There's some other enhancements
as well.

</p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 4482: athena(1): have CONSUMP ruleset fire when econ is disabled.

  </li><li> Bug 4504: athena(1): New civgroups gofers for subsistence/non-subsistence agriculture.
  </li><li> Bug 4506: athena_ingest(1): Include "ingestion support" script in ingestion script
  </li><li> Bug 4507: athena_ingest(1): "Random Violence" event
  </li><li> Bug 4508: athena_ingest(1): Can edit ingested events 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.2.0-B4, 29 April 2014</h3>
<p>At the request of TRISA, this build represents the first in a new build
numbering scheme.  This will allow future releases of Athena to be deployed
in the field quicker. Essentially, the build number is appended to the future 
version of Athena.  So this is build 4 of version 6.2.0 of Athena to be 
released at a future date.  This build contains a number of changes to simplify
the map UI.  There are also some minor transparent changes to the wmsclient(n)
API that do not change the functionality but make the interface more robust.   
There is also a few bug fixes.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4474: athena(1): WMS client should not require base URL in calls to get a map
</li><li> Bug 4475: athena(1): WMS client should store map as data, not as image
</li><li> Bug 4476: wmsclient(n): implement automated tests
</li><li> Bug 4477: wmsclient(n): query parameters should be optional on a map request
</li><li> Bug 4478: Man pages: need man page entries for wmsclient(n), wmscap(n) and wmsexcept(n)
</li><li> Bug 4468: athena(1): mapviewer clean up
</li><li> Bug 4469: Belief System bgerror

</li><li> Bug 4481: athena(1): Project Info 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 7.0.3, 17 April 2014</h3>
<p>This build contains a Web Map Service (WMS) client that acts like an order
dialog that allows the user to pick and choose a geo-referenced map from an
Open GIS compliant WMS server.  This is a general capability but should be 
useful in the DCGS-A environment as well.  There is also some more GUI 
simplification and added helps for the new belief system.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4455: Add basekits for Linux 32 and 64 bit builds to tools directory
</li><li> Bug 4456: make_tar utility should automatically tag 64 bit installer .tgz with 64 bit designation in file name

</li></ul>

<h3>Build 7.0.2, 14 April 2014</h3>
<p>This build contains a complete reimplementation of belief systems to be
pure Tcl/Tk based rather than rely on SQLite. Particular attention should be
paid to this part of the build when testing.  There is also an upgrade to
Tcl/Tk 8.6 in this build along with a few bug fixes.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4434: Installers should include the correct list of maps

</li><li> Bug 4453: athena(1): Compute semantic hook narratives on demand 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 7.0.1, 13 March 2014</h3>
<p>This build consists mainly of bug fixes found on the Athena 6 branch that
need to be folded into the trunk.  There is also the introduction of a new
map projection that converts pixel location to lat/long and MGRS. A sample 
map is included with this build to test this functionality.

<h3>Build 6.0.10, 6 February 2014</h3>
<p>This build contains a complete retooling of the layout of Athena's tabs to
be in line with the PMESII-PT acronym.  Thus you will see tabs titled:
"Political", "Military", "Economics", "Social", "Infrastructure", and 
"Information" to correspond to the first part of this acronym.  There are
also tabs for "Physical" and "Time" that correspond to the last part.  The
"Detail" tab and "Strategy" tab are on their own since they cross-cut so much
of all areas.  There is one significant new feature in this build: 
unemployment is now disaggregated to neighborhoods according to the amount
of production infrastructure present.  Part of this algorithm includes
computing those in the labor force that are geographically unemployed since 
they are unwilling to go a parameter controlled distance to get to work.  
This number is fed back into the CGE on the next tock and further impacts 
the economy.  There are a host of bug fixes in the build as well.

</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.0.8, 12 December 2013</h3>
<p>This build contains some significant changes to how the MAINTAIN tactic
operates.  The analyst specifies repair modes instead of spending modes and 
then Athena spends according to best efforts to maintain the infrastructure
as instructed.  There's also a few bug fixes to the infrastrucuture model.
There are some new NUMBER gofer(n) rules and a new export capability that
exports the state of Athena rather than the history.  This should make it
easier for the end user when moving from one version of Athena to another and
when declassifying scenarios.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4262: athena(1): ECON:* order help pages
</li><li> Bug 4269: Small values for bktsPerYear yields negative number of plants
</li><li> Bug 4270: repair level of zero causes bgerror

</li><li> Bug 4278: athena(1): Need to implement gofer::NUMBER 'coverage' rule & executive function.
</li><li> Bug 4271: athena(1): Strategy executive commands
</li><li> Bug 4272: help(5): optionlist, option macros

</li><li> Bug 4282: htools(n): "pretty" tables
</li><li> Bug 4280: athena(1): Use pretty tables in help(5) 
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.0.7, 6 December 2013</h3>
<p>This build has some quite notable new functionality.  The second part of
the manufacturing infrastructure has been implemented.  This means that
the infrastructure now degrades with time if the new MAINTAIN tactic is not
used by an actor to keep it from going into disrepair.  Note that you can
disable the degradation of infrastructure (and thus the need to MAINTAIN it)
by not allocating any of it to actors and let the SYSTEM agent own it all.
The economic model will be impacted if the infrastructure is allowed to degrade
too far.  Cut/Copy/Paste is implemented for Blocks, Conditions and Tactics!
This means that you can cut and copy any part (or all) of one actors strategy
and paste it.  Once pasted, editing can then take place to
make possibly invalid blocks valid.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4248: athena(1): remove econ.idleFrac from application
</li><li> Bug 4250: athena(1): remove econcapbrowser(n) from application
</li><li> Bug 4260: athena(1): Manufacturing Plant Infrastructure, part II
</li><li> Bug 4247: athena(1): Implement needed gopher::NUMBER rule "security" and update it's executive function.

</li><li> Bug 4259: athena(1): Mark II Strategy help pages
</li><li> Bug 4261: athena(1): STRATEGY:* help pages
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.0.6, 2 December 2013</h3>
<p>This build contains the first part of the manufacturing infrastructure model.
Manufacturing plants can be allocated to actors and neighborhoods.  The econ
model uses the capacity computed by the infrastructure model as the capacity
of the goods sector.  There's a few bug fixes and some code cleanup in a 
couple of the Mark II tactics.  The built in script editor now has better
syntax checking.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4243: athena(1): Manufacturing Plant Infrastructure, part I
</li><li> Bug 4220: Actors and System Agent share tactic lists
</li><li> Bug 4221: athena(1): gofer::NBHOODS not returning nbhoods properly
</li><li> Bug 4234: athena(1): Require tablelist 5.10

</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.0.5, 18 November 2013</h3>
<p>This build contains the last tactic to be converted to the Mark II Strategy
Engine: ASSIGN.  It also contains some new deployment modes for the DEPLOY 
tactic, some bug fixes to the new strategy engine and a few minor 
enhancements.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4208: SPEND tactic displays $amt instead of numerical value
</li><li> Bug 4209: FUND tactic help page is missing actor
</li><li> Bug 4219: Hook ID does not require unique value
</li><li> Bug 4222: athena(1): have export command write the version of Athena used for export
</li><li> Bug 4225: athena(1): expose the pfactor attribute in the nbhood object

<h3>Build 6.0.4, 7 November 2013</h3>
<p>This build contains what is likely that last major update to the Mark II 
Strategy Engine.  Most of the work is complete, but there's a few loose ends
that will be tied up in later builds.  There is now a new neighborhoods 
gofer and some bug fixes as well.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4154: athena(1): update autogen to create new-style strategies.
</li><li> Bug 4205: athena(1): Mark II BROADCAST Tactic

</li><li> Bug 4206: athena(1): gofer::NBHOODS
</li><li> Bug 4207: athena(1): Mark II SUPPORT Tactic
</li><li> Bug 4214: athena(1): Remove obsolete strategy code, Part 1
</li><li> Bug 4216: undo causes error when referencing deleted objects
</li><li> Bug 4217: athena(1): Mark II DEPLOY Tactic
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.0.3, 28 October 2013</h3>
<p>This build contains wholesale changes to the Mark II Strategy Engine that 
includes the addition of many more tactics and some changes to how some of 
the tactics are specified.  There are more robust ways of specifying how an
actor spends his money on certain tactics.  Some of the tactics have been
updated to user gofer(n) objects to retrieve list of entities from Athena
upon tactic execution.</p>

<p>Spend as much time as is necessary to vet each of the revamped tactics. The
on-line help for all the implemented tactics should be available to aid in
testing.

<h3>Build 6.0.2, 3 October 2013</h3>
<p>This build contains the preliminary version of the Mark II Strategy Engine.
Only two conditions and a subset of the tactics have been converted to the
new engine; the remainder are unavailable in this version.</p>

<p>The focus in this version should be on testing strategy editing, and execution
of the tactics that currently exist.  There are new Detail Browser pages, and
similar content in the Strategy/Editor tab that needs to be examined for
anomalies.  Anything that's unclear or peculiar looking should be reported.</p>

<p>The on-line help has not yet been updated.

</p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4147: athena(1): change the units of production in the black sector to blackBKT
</li><li> Bug 4148: Mark II Strategy Engine Preliminaries
</li><li> Bug 4153: Mark II Strategy Engine Installed
</li><li> Bug 4156: athena(1): Multiple item delete in Strategy/Editor
</li></ul>

<h3>Build 6.0.1, 25 September 2013</h3>
<p>This build contains some enhancements to the SAM and CGE in the econ model.
Specifically, the SAM now takes remittances as a direct input and balances
the goods and pop sectors on lock by assuming any difference in total 
expenditures and total revenue in those sectors is aggregate savings (which
could be negative). The CGE now takes total geographic unemployment (GU) into
consideration when computing an equilibrium. The CGE also now has inputs
for price and wage indices for use by a future inflation model. There's also
an enhancement to how Athena produces a bgerror.
