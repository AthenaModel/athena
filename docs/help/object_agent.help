    An agent is a <cref /object "simulation object"> that can own a 
    <term strategy>: that is, it is an object that can execute
    <term tactic>s subject to certain <term condition>s to
    achieve its goals.<p>

    Political <term actor>s are the primary kind of agent in
    Athena; actors have financial and personnel assets that they
    use to achieve their political goals.  In addition, there is also
    the <cref /object/agent/system>, which uses a strategy to drive 
    other parts of the simulation, e.g., to displace civilian groups
    or to make events happen at particular times.

page /object/agent system "SYSTEM agent" {
    <sotitle>

    The SYSTEM is an <term agent> that uses its strategy to drive
    parts of the simulation that are not owned by 
    <term actor>s.  For example, the SYSTEM can make things happen 
    at pre-determined times, or use the
    <cref /object/tactic/flow> to move civilian populations
    around the playbox.
