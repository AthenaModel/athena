Athena Simulation Modules
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the app_sim(n) package, which contains the
modules of Tcl code specific to the Athena simulation,
athena_sim(1), which is invoked by athena(1).

NOTE: Because the modules in this package represent 
application-level code, they are generally defined as singletons
and live in the global namespace.
