# DESCRIPTION:
#    athena_sim(1): Simulation Event, FLOOD
#
#    This module implements the FLOOD event, which represents
#    a flood in a neighborhood at a particular week.
#
#    The "midlist", neighborhood, and start week are usually set on 
#    creation.
# 
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# FIRST, create the class.
::wintel::simevent define FLOOD "Flood" {
    A "Flood" event represents a natural disaster consisting of
    serious flooding in a neighborhood with attendant loss of life.

    Set the "Duration" parameter to the length of the flooding in weeks;
    set the "Coverage" parameter to the fraction of the neighborhood's
    residents who are aware of the flood and whose attitudes are affected
    by it (nominally 1.0).<p>

} {
    A "Flood" event is represented in Athena as a "block" in a
    the SYSTEM agent's strategy.  The block will contain an
    ABSIT tactic that will create a DISASTER abstract situation
    at the requested time for the requested duration.  See the <i>Athena
    Rules Document</i> for the attitude affects of this situation.
