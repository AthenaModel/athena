#
# DESCRIPTION:
#    athena_sim(1): Simulation Event, DEMO
#
#    This module implements the DEMO event, which represents a non-violent 
#    demonstration by residents of a neighborhood.
# 
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# FIRST, create the class.
::wintel::simevent define DEMO "Demonstration" {
    A "Demonstration" event represents a non-violent public assembly
    of people who are supporting a cause.  The event will affect all
    groups who reside in the neighborhood, but the effects will 
    depend on whether the residents like or dislike (have a positive
    or negative horizontal relationship with) the groups that are
    demonstrating.<p>

    Set the "Demonstrating Groups" parameter to the names of the 
    civilian groups who are demonstrating; and set the "Coverage" 
    parameter to indicate the fraction of the neighborhood's residents
    that are aware of the demonstration and whose attitudes are 
    affected by it.<p>

    One or more groups can demonstrate in the neighborhood during 
    the same week.  It doesn't matter whether they are demonstrating
    together or for separate (and possibly opposing) causes.<p>

    The duration of a "Demonstration" event is always 1 week; reports from 
    successive weeks will generate additional events.  
} {
    A "Demonstration" event is represented in Athena as a "block" in the 
    SYSTEM agent's strategy.  The block will contain a DEMO tactic for
    each individual group that is demonstrating in the neighborhood.
    This tactic triggers the DEMO rule set; see the <i>Athena
    Rules Document</i> for the attitude effects.
