# DESCRIPTION:
#    athena_sim(1): Critical Input File manager.  Granted, it's now a 
#    database table rather than a file, but "cif" is hallowed by time.
#
#    This module is responsible for adding orders to the cif table and
#    for supporting application undo/redo.

    # redoing    - If 1, we're in the middle of [cif redo].  If 0,
    #              we're not.
    #
    # redoStack  - Stack of redo records.  Item "end" is the head of the
    #              stack.  The variable contains the empty list if there
    #              is nothing to redo.  Each record is a dictionary
    #              containing one item to redo.
    #
    # Redo Stack Records
    #
    # Every record has the following keys:
    #
    #   narrative - The text returned by [cif canredo] for use by the GUI.
    #   orders    - A list of name/parmdict pairs, in the order to be redone.
