# DESCRIPTION:
#    app_sim(n) Simulation Sanity Checks
#
#    This module defines the "onlock" sanity check, which determines
#    whether the scenario can be locked, and the "ontick" sanity 
#    check, which determines whether simulation execution can proceed.
#
#    NOTE: The strategy sanity check is performed by strategy(sim).
