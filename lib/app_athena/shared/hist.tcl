# DESCRIPTION:
#
# History is saved for t=0 on lock and for t > 0 at the end of each
# time-step's activities.  [hist tick] saves all history that is
# saved at every tick; [hist econ] saves all history that is saved
# at each econ tock.

    # purge t
    #
    # t   - The sim time in ticks at which to purge
    #
    # Removes "future history" from the history tables when going
    # backwards in time.  We are paused at time t; all time t 
    # history is behind us.  So purge everything later.
    #
    # On unlock, this will be used to purge all history, including
    # time 0 history, by setting t to -1. NOTE: in the case of t = -1
    # its *much* quicker to leave out the WHERE clause
