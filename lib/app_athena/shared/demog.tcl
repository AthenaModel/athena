# athena_sim(1): Demographic Model, main module.

# This module is responsible for computing demographics for neighborhoods
# and neighborhood groups.  The data is stored in the demog_g, demog_n,
# and demog_local tables.  Entries in the demog_n and demog_g tables
# are created and deleted by nbhood(sim) and civgroups(sim) respectively,
# as neighborhoods and civilian groups come and go.  The (single)
# entry in the demog_local table is created/replaced on <analyze pop>.
