# DESCRIPTION:
#   athena_sim(1): Simulation Rebase Manager 
#
#   Rebasing the simulation is the creation of a new scenario that when
#   locked will be equivalent to the current state of the simulation.
#   This module is responsible for updating the scenario data for this 
#   purpose.  The process is as follows:
#
#   * Rebasing requires data from the previous time tick.  
#     [rebase prepare] saves this data at the beginning of each [tick].
#   * The user sends SIM:REBASE, usually via the Orders menu.
#   * SIM:REBASE calls [sim mutate rebase], which handles the simulation
#     control issues.
#   * [sim mutate rebase] calls [scenario rebase], which handles the
#     scenario issues, e.g., purging history and so forth.
#   * [scenario rebase] calls [rebase save] to actually save the 
#     required state to the scenario tables.
