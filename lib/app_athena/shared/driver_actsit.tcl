    #    a             - The activity being performed
    #    personnel     - The number of effective personnel
    #    coverage      - The coverage fraction of the activity, > 0.0.
    #
    # The individual driver type can add the following fields to the fdict:
    #
    #    mitigates     - A list of absit types actually being mitigated by
