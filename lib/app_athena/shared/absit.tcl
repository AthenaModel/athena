# DESCRIPTION:
#    athena_sim(1) Abstract Situation module
#
#    This module defines a singleton, "absit", which is used to
#    manage the collection of abstract situation objects, or absits.
#    Absits are situations; see situation(sim) for additional details.
#
#    Entities defined in this file:
#
#    absit      -- The absit ensemble
#    absitType  -- The type for the absit objects.
#
#    A single snit::type could do both jobs--but at the expense
#    of accidentally creating an absit object if an incorrect absit
#    method name is used.
#
#    * Absits are created, updated, and deleted via the "mutate *" 
#      commands and the ABSIT:* orders.
#
#    * This module calls the absit rule on "absit assess", which is 
#      done as part of the time advance.
