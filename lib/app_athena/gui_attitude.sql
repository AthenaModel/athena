--    SQL Schema: Application-specific views, Attitude area
--
--    This file is loaded by scenario.tcl!
--
--    GUI views translate the internal data formats of the scenariodb(n)
--    tables into presentation format.  They are defined here instead of
--    in scenariodb(n) so that they can contain application-specific
--    SQL functions.
