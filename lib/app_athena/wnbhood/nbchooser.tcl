# DESCRIPTION:
#    nbchooser(n): A widget for selecting neighborhoods
# from a hierarchical tree.
#
# This widget has two main areas: a tablelist(n) for displaying the 
# hierarchy of neighborhoods and a mapcanvas(n) for displaying the
# neighborhood boundaries.  As the user clicks to choose which 
# polygons should be included as part of a scenario the polygon display
# changes accordingly indicating the currently selected set of polygons
# and greying out the set of deselected polygons.
